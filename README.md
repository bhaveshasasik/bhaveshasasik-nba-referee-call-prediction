## Introduction

ClutchCalls - Bet on your favorite referees.

We, at ClutchCalls, have successfully undertaken a comprehensive project focused on refining the NBA's two-minute report dataset using Pandas, ensuring that it aligns seamlessly with our project objectives. Leveraging the power of SciKit Learn, we meticulously trained a model, considering a myriad of hyperparameters, to provide accurate predictions regarding individual referees' correct/incorrect calls per game within specific team matchups. Our commitment to excellence extends to prompt engineering, optimizing results and enhancing the overall efficiency of our model. Taking a step further, we utilized these predictions to formulate lines, establishing over-under betting values that present a lucrative opportunity for gamblers. This strategic approach not only maximizes potential profits for app creators but also strikes a balance with the broader market usage. Looking ahead, our intention is to publish an API, opening doors for potential collaborations with companies such as PrizePicks and DraftKings, thereby expanding the reach and impact of our innovative sports betting model.
## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi/blob/main/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Demo

## Deploy Your Own

You can clone & deploy it to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fdigitros%2Fnextjs-fastapi%2Ftree%2Fmain)

## Developing Locally

You can clone & create this repo with the following command

```bash
npx create-next-app nextjs-fastapi --example "https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi"
```

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The FastApi server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
